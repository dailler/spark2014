Replay removes the obsolete proofattempts in manual proof:
math_euclid.ads:3:63: medium: divide by zero might fail [possible explanation: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
math_euclid.ads:9:14: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Divides (X, A mod B)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: medium: divide by zero might fail
math_euclid.ads:9:28: medium: range check might fail
Now launching gnatprove in normal mode; it should reuse the proof:
math_euclid.ads:3:63: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:14: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Divides (X, A mod B) (e.g. when A = 17 and B = 6 and X = 2)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: range check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
